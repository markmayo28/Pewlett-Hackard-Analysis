# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard has noticed that many their team that is approaching retirement eligibility age. They have asked us to analyze the workforce to see how and where this will affect the future of their workforce.  Specifically, they have asked us to focus on:

-	Number of employees that are approaching retirement eligibility by title
-	Current employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Resources

- Data Sources: employees.csv, titles.csv, and dept_emp.csv (provided by Pewlett Hackard)
- Software: PostgreSQL 11, pgAdmin4 5.2, Visual Studio Code 1.55.2

## Employees Approaching Retirement Eligibility by Title

The table below reflects the number of retirement eligible employees by current title. Key take-aways are:

-	Pewlett Hackard is going to be hit very hard in the Senior Engineer arena
-	Senior Staff will also be a major area of concern
-	Now is the time to start looking at a progression plan to cover these senior positions as retirements begin to take effect
-	Pewlett Hackard needs to start recruiting heavily to bring in new talent to fill the positions vacated through retirement and promotions necessitated by retirements.

## Employees Eligible to Participate in a Mentorship Program

Analysis of the employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program reveal the points:

-	The mentor eligible employees are well distributed across company roles
-	The number of available mentors does not appear sufficient to cover the number of projected vacancies
-	This is particularly true in the senior staff area
-	Pewlett Hackard should consider expanding the criteria to participate in the mentorship program

## Summary of Analysis

1.	As shown in the chart above, Pewlett Hackard may have to replace as many 90,000 team members as the “Silver Tsunami” rolls through the company. Of course, not all who are eligible to retire will take advantage as soon as they are eligible. Pewlett Hackard should begin to survey the list of employees provided through this analysis to determine their intentions and be able to better shape the response and action plan.

2.	Based on the criteria provided, the table below shows how many team members are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

3.	The number of mentors available using the current criteria will fall short of what is needed to successfully mentor new employees that will fill the vacancies created by the “Silver Tsunami”.  The recommendations listed in mentorship analysis above may help to overcome these problems. The table below shows a comparison by roles of mentors and potential retirees as well as giving an approximate ratio of how many new team members each mentor would be responsible for. This makes it clear that there will need to be adjustments made to the mentorship program if it is to be successful.
