# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard has noticed that many their team that is approaching retirement eligibility age. They have asked us to analyze the workforce to see how and where this will affect the future of their workforce.  Specifically, they have asked us to focus on:

-	Number of employees that are approaching retirement eligibility by title
-	Current employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Resources

- Data Sources: employees.csv, titles.csv, and dept_emp.csv (provided by Pewlett Hackard)
- Software: PostgreSQL 11, pgAdmin4 5.2, Visual Studio Code 1.55.2

## Employees Approaching Retirement Eligibility by Title

The table below reflects the number of retirement eligible employees by current title. Key take-aways are:

-	Pewlett Hackard is going to be hit very hard in the Senior Engineer arena
-	Senior Staff will also be a major area of concern
-	Now is the time to start looking at a progression plan to cover these senior positions as retirements begin to take effect
-	Pewlett Hackard needs to start recruiting heavily to bring in new talent to fill the positions vacated through retirement and promotions necessitated by retirements.

## Employees Eligible to Participate in a Mentorship Program

The table below reflects the number of team members eligible to participate in the mentorship program by title. Key take-aways are:

-	The mentor eligible employees are well distributed across company roles
-	The number of available mentors does not appear sufficient to cover the number of projected vacancies
-	This is particularly true in the senior staff area
-	Pewlett Hackard should consider expanding the criteria to participate in the mentorship program
